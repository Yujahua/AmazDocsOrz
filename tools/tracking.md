# tracking

The so-called burying point is to collect some information in a specific process in the application to track the status of the application, and then to further optimize the product or provide operational data support, including the number of visits, the number of visitors, and stay Time On Site, Page Views and Bounce Rate. Such information collection can be roughly divided into two types: page statistics (track this virtual page view) and statistical operation behavior (track this button by an event)

>Note
1. Don't pursue perfection too much.
2. Regarding data burying, it is very important. The purpose of burying is to make better use of data. The pursuit of burying is high quality rather than accuracy, and imperfect data should be used to promote the next step. This is an easy pit for many data products, so you should always be alert to yourself.
